## Description

This is a package for the Laravel 5 Framework that adds basic support for managing themes. It allows you to seperate your views & your assets files in seperate folders, and supports for theme extending! Awesome :)

## How it works

Very simple, you create a folder for each Theme in 'resources/views' and keep all your views seperated. The same goes for assets: create a folder for each theme in yput 'public' directory. Set your active theme and you are done. The rest of your application remains theme-agnostic (c), which means that when you `View::make('index')` you will access the `index.blade.php` from your selected theme's folder. Same goes for your assets.

Features:

* Views & Asset seperation in theme folders
* Theme inheritence: Extend any theme and create Theme hierarcies (WordPress style!)
* Intergrates [Orchestra/Asset](http://orchestraplatform.com/docs/3.0/components/asset) to provide Asset dependencies managment

## Installation

Edit your project's `composer.json` file to require:

    "require": {
        "igaster/laravel-theme": "dev-master"
    }

and install with `composer update`


Add the services provider in `app/config/app.php`, providers array. Because this package depends on Orchestra\Asset for asset managment you need to include all these providers. IMPORTANT: place them above Laravels `RouteServiceProvider` since routing should be occured after configuring your Themes.

    'igaster\laravelTheme\themeServiceProvider',
    'Orchestra\Asset\AssetServiceProvider',
    'Orchestra\Html\HtmlServiceProvider',


It is recommended that you add the Asset facade in your `Facades` array in `app/config/app.php`

    'Asset' => 'Orchestra\Support\Facades\Asset',


Almost Done. You only need to bulish configuration file to your application with

    artisan vendor:publish

That's it. You are now ready to start theming your applications!

## Defining themes

Simple define your themes in the `themes` array in `config\theme.php`. The format one theme is very simple:

    // Select a name for your theme
    'theme-name' => [

    	// Theme to extend
    	// Defaults to null (=none)

        'extends'	 	=> 'theme-to-extend',

        // The path where the view are stored
        // Defaults to 'theme-name' 
        // It is relative to /resources/views (or what ever is defined in )

        'views-path' 	=> 'path-to-views',

        // The path where the assets are stored
        // Defaults to 'theme-name' 
        // It is relative to /public

        'asset-path' 	=> 'path-to-assets',   // defaults to: theme-name
    ],

all settings are optional and can be ommited.

## Switching Themes

    igaster\laravelTheme\Themes::set('theme-name');

## Extending themes

You can set a theme to extend an other. When you are requesting a view/asset that doesn't exist in your active theme, then it will be resolved from it's parent theme. You can easily create variations of your theme by simply overiding your views/themes that are different. 

All themes fall back to the default laravel folders if a resource is not found on the theme folders. So for example you can leave your common libraries (jquery/bootstrap ...) in your `public` folder and use them from all themes. No need to dublicate common assets for each theme!

As an extra bonus this package intergrates with [Orchestra/Asset](http://orchestraplatform.com/docs/3.0/components/asset) to provide sophisticated asset managment.

## Assets

This packages makes use of the [Orchestra/Asset](http://orchestraplatform.com/docs/3.0/components/asset) component. All the features are explained in the official documentation. However some Blade-specific sugar has been added to ease your work. So here how to build your views:

In any blade file when you need to refer to a script or css: (dont use single/double quotes)

    @css(filename)
    @js(filename)

Please note that you are just defining your css/js files but not actually dumping them in html. Usually you only need write your css/js decleration in one place on the head/bottom of you file. So open your master layout and place:

    {!! Asset::styles() !!}
    {!! Asset::scripts() !!}

exactly where you want write your declerations. If you are refering to a local file then it will check that it exists on the active theme or else an exception will be thrown.

## Assets dependencies

Well this is an [Orchestra/Asset](http://orchestraplatform.com/docs/3.0/components/asset) feature explained well in the documentation. Long story short you can:

    @css (filename, alias, depends-on)
    @js  (filename, alias, depends-on)

and your assets dependencies will be auto resolved. Your assets will be exported in the correct order. A short example:

    @js  (jquery.js,    jq)
    @js  (bootstrap.js, bs, jq)
